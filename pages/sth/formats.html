<h1>Software Tools in Haskell: On Formats</h1>
<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
<p>Ostensibly, many software tools operate on streams of text. But not all text is created equal: some text is <em>formatted</em>. Whenever a character in a text stream doesn’t “mean what it says”, so to speak, we have a format. For example many tools follow the convention that the character sequence <code>\n</code> denotes the unicode character with code point 0A. The backslash is not a literal backslash. One of the reasons why text is so useful is that many different human-readable formats can be layered on top of it (even more than one at a time, though this can be dangerous).</p>
<p>Keeping in mind what <em>kind</em> of text a tool expects to receive and produce can help lead us to simpler and more consistent programs. On this page we’ll keep a list of a few different textual formats with links to more information about them.</p>
<h2 id="unformats">Unformats</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unformatted Text.</strong> Uninterpreted streams of unicode characters.</li>
<li><strong>Escaped Text.</strong> This is a stream of characters where certain sequences, called <em>escape codes</em>, are shorthand for other characters. This is a useful way to type otherwise untypeable characters. There are a few widely used escape code standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C">C-style</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_control_code_chart">ASCII-style</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references">HTML-style</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Lined Text.</strong> Copies of a character or sequence of characters (such as <code>\n</code> on unix or <code>\r\n</code> on some other systems) are singled out and called <em>line separators</em>. Maximal subsequences of characters which contain no parts of a line separator are called <em>lines</em>. This format is given preferential treatment in unix-like systems and many other formats are built on it.</li>
<li><strong>Delimited Text.</strong> A special character or sequence of characters, different from the line separator, is singled out and called called the <em>field separator</em>. Lines are called <em>records</em> and maximal subsequences containing no line separators or field separators are called <em>fields</em>; delimited text is an extremely cheap matrix or database. There is no single standard field separator, so we have to specify whether a particular file is (e.g.) <em>tab-delimited</em> or <em>comma-delimited</em> (or something else).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course delimited text can be thought of as lined text, which can be thought of as a stream of characters. But the point is that these formats have extra meaning baked in which informs how a tool should behave.</p>
<h2 id="markup">Markup</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML.</strong> Markup for web browsers. Most recent version is HTML5. Maintained by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">W3C</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Markdown.</strong> An attempt to standardize some semantic conventions people have been using with plain text for decades. (This site is maintained in Markdown.) As of 2016 there is an effort to produce a better formal spec called <a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>, but it is notable that even the original, buggy, poorly defined version worked well enough to become popular.</li>
<li><strong>JSON.</strong> The name is short for JavaScript Object Notation. This is a markup language for structured data. Described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159">RFC 7159</a>. Also has its own <a href="http://www.json.org/">webpage</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="really-complicated">Really complicated</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>PostScript.</strong> A stack-oriented page description language. Meant to be written by people or programs and read by printers. Specified by the third edition of the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf">PostScript Language Reference Manual</a>.</li>

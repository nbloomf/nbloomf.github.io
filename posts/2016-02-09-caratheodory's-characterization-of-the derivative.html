<p>Today I came upon a very nice idea in calculus, completely by accident, while preparing some lecture notes. Maybe this is well-known, but calculus and analysis have always been weak spots for me and I found the idea to be very enlightening.</p>
<p>Calculus is a nice place to start introducing students to the idea of mathematical proof; they tend to have enough confidence in their algebra skills that “why” questions are becoming more important. And so, I try to include some proofs here and there. One result, however, whose usual textbook proof has always seemed unsatisfying to me is the Chain Rule.</p>
<div class="result">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> be real functions such that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="math inline">\(g(a)\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f \circ g\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, and moreover <span class="math display">\[(f \circ g)^\prime (a) = f^\prime(g(a)) \cdot g^\prime(a).\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>The proof given in most textbooks I’ve used involves introducing new variables in a way that strikes me as a little too handwavy.</p>
<p>I poked around online looking for alternative proofs and found a paper by Stephen Kuhn in the American Math Monthly called “The Derivative á la Carathéodory”. The main idea, attributed to a textbook written by Constantin Carathéodory, is the following alternative characterization of differentiability.</p>
<div class="result">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a real function and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> a real number. Then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> if and only if there exists a real function <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is continuous at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[f(x) - f(a) = \varphi(x)(x-a).\]</span> In this case, we have <span class="math inline">\(\varphi(a) = f^\prime(a)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Where differentiability is defined as usual via the limit of a difference quotient.</p>
<div class="result">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a real function and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> a real number. We say that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> if <span class="math display">\[\lim_{x \rightarrow a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\]</span> exists. In this case, the value of this limit is denoted <span class="math inline">\(f^\prime(a)\)</span> and called the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. The real function <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto f^\prime(x)\)</span> is called the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>It is straightforward to show that Carathéodory’s characterization is equivalent to the limit-based definition. And while it is less concrete for computational purposes, Carathéodory makes the proof of the chain rule very slick (and not at all handwavy, to my taste).</p>
<div class="result">
<div class="proof">
<p>(Chain Rule.) Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> be real functions and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> a real number such that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> differentiable at <span class="math inline">\(g(a)\)</span>. By Carathéodory’s characterization, there is a function <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[g(x) - g(a) = \varphi(x)(x-a)\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and a function <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[f(y) - f(g(a)) = \psi(y)(y - g(a))\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>; in particular for <span class="math inline">\(y = g(x)\)</span>. Now substituting yields <span class="math display">\[f(g(x)) - f(g(a)) = \psi(g(x))\varphi(x)(x-a).\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, it is continuous at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, and so <span class="math inline">\(\psi(g(x))\)</span> is continuous at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, and thus <span class="math inline">\(\psi(g(x))\varphi(x)\)</span> is continuous at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Again by Carathéodory, <span class="math inline">\(f \circ g\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, and <span class="math display">\[(f \circ g)^\prime(a) = \psi(g(a))\varphi(a) = f^\prime(g(a)) \cdot g^\prime(a).\]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nice. :)</p>
<p>On the one hand, I can see why this idea has gotten left out of more modern books. Often calculus is a cookbook class where the emphasis is on computation rather than abstract understanding. (And that “there exists” in Carathéodory’s characterization might be scary.) On the other hand, the idea is so beautiful, and following the paper “Fréchet vs. Carathéodory” by Ernesto Acosta G. and Cesar Delgado G., also in American Math Monthly, generalizes nicely.</p>
<p>I think I’ll use this next time I teach calculus.</p>
